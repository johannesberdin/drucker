# Print mails from everywhere

Printing emails and email attachments is super annoying to me. Despite the question why I still print them out, I need to print some documents caused by German/European law regulations.

I'm on the go most of the time and I really do not want to replace my lovely Brother printing beast with an internet-connected one and because the fact that the printer is already connected to the apptimists HQ server, I decided to write a small mail poll for receiving mails from a dedicated inbox and print them out in a manner I like.

## Feature list
- Print all mail attachments
- Print mail thread including original message and forwarded/quoted mails
- Configure allowed senders to prevent empty paper trays

## In development
- Write some setup instructions
- Code some test cases
